# ICS-201-Video-Game
 when i started this game, it was a space shooter game and i later
 changed it to a feeding bunnies game so all the variables and images are still
 named after the space game (spaceship = carrot bag, aliens = bunnies, bullets = carrots)

use the arrow keys (left & right to move)
and the space bar to shoot
